PHASE 1|

Mindy Baker: We have worked individually, uploaded our notebooks to github and held weekly conference calls to discuss our work. I have set up the github repository and added team members as contributors. We have been working together to tackle the task of learning to use github.  |  
Eric Kavales: Phase 1- We decided to work on the project individually and use conference calls to discuss progress and/or areas of difficulty. Since Mindy was the first to upload code to GitHub we will be submitting her code. I also uploaded my code but have since deleted it as it is not for submission. We reviewed the code and made minor suggestions and agreed, besides variable names, all our codes were very similar. We have also assited each other on navigating the usage of github.    
Kyshia Patillo: As Mindy and Eric stated, we have worked individually and have held weekly conference calls to discuss the project as well as how to use github. I am in agreement with the code submitted by Mindy for Phase 1.
