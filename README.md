PHASE 1

Mindy Baker: We have worked individually, uploaded our notebooks to github and held weekly conference calls to discuss our work. I have set up the github repository and added team members as contributors. We have been working together to tackle the task of learning to use github.    
Eric Kavales: Phase 1- We decided to work on the project individually and use conference calls to discuss progress and/or areas of difficulty. Since Mindy was the first to upload code to GitHub we will be submitting her code. I also uploaded my code but have since deleted it as it is not for submission. We reviewed the code and made minor suggestions and agreed, besides variable names, all our codes were very similar. We have also assited each other on navigating the usage of github.    
Kyshia Patillo: As Mindy and Eric stated, we have worked individually and have held weekly conference calls to discuss the project as well as how to use github. I am in agreement with the code submitted by Mindy for Phase 1.  

PHASE 2

Mindy Baker: We continued our weekly conference calls for Phase 2 and uploaded each of our notebooks to github for team review. Once we have had an opportunity each other's work, we discuss and make changes. We seem to have a better grasp on using github. 

Eric Kavales: As Mindy stated, we held calls to ensure we are all on the same page as we move forward through the project. Our code for phase 2 is agreed upon and is ready for submission. 

Kyshia Patillo:  As stated, we continued the weekly call to discuss Phase 2. I initially had issues downloading my file from Jupyter but with some suggestions from the team and some trial and error I have since figured it out.  I am in agreement with the code submitted for Phase 2.  

PHASE 3

Mindy Baker: The team continued with weekly conference calls and shared individual notebooks to improve the final product. Discussions focused on successes, areas for improvement and various methods for achieving the final product.

Eric Kavales: We held our weekly conference calls to discuss challenges and successes. All code has been agreed upon and submitted for final review.
